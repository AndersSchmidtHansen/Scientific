<p>On his return from the expedition against the German camp<a href="#fn" title="Ahlberg, P.E. 1990.  Glimpsing the hidden majority. Nature 344: 23.">1</a>, King Henry besieged Danvilliers, and those within would not surrender. They got the worst of it, but our powder failed us; so they had a good shot at our men. There was a culverin-shot passed through the tent of H. de Rohan, which hit a gentleman leg who was of his household. I had to finish the cutting off of it, which I did without applying the hot irons.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) and they are: <br />
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$</p>

<p>The King sent for powder to Sedan, and when it came we began the attack mere vigorously than before, so that a breach was made. MM. de Guise and the Constable, being in the King's chamber<a href="#fn" title="Epel, D. and R. Steinhardt. 1974. Activation of sea urchin eggs by a calcium ionophore. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 71: 1915-1919.">2</a>, told him, and they agreed that next day they would assault the town, and were confident they would enter into it; and it must be kept secret, for fear the enemy should come to hear of it; and each promised not to speak of it to any man. Now there was a groom of the King's chamber, who being laid under the King's camp-bed to sleep, heard they were resolved to attack the town next day. So he told the secret to a certain captain, saying that they would make the attack next day for certain, and he had heard it from the King, and prayed the said captain to speak of it to no man, which he promised; but his promise did not hold, and forthwith he <a href='http://externallink.com/' >disclosed it to a captain</a>, and this captain to a captain, and the captains to some of the soldiers, saying always, "Say nothing." And it was just so much hid, that next day early in the morning there was seen the greater part of the soldiers with their boots and breeches cut loose at the knee for the better mounting of the breach. </p>

<p><img src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Diagram_human_cell_nucleus.svg/280px-Diagram_human_cell_nucleus.svg.png'  alt="The eukaryotic cell nucleus. Visible in this diagram are the ribosome-studded double membranes of the nuclear envelope, the DNA (complexed as chromatin), and the nucleolus. Within the cell nucleus is a viscous liquid called nucleoplasm, similar to the cytoplasm found outside the nucleus." /></p>

<p>The King was told of this rumour that ran through the camp, that the attack was to be made; whereat he was astonished, seeing there were but three in that advice, who had promised each other to tell it to no man. The King sent for M. de Guise, to know if he had spoken of this attack; he swore and affirmed to him he had not told it to anybody; and M. the Constable said the same, and told the King they must know for certain who had declared this secret counsel, seeing they were but three. Inquiry was made from captain to captain. In the end they found the truth; for one said, "It was such an one told me," and another said the same, till it came to the first of all, who declared he had heard it from the groom of the King's chamber, called Guyard, a native of Blois, son of a barber of the late King Francis. The King sent for him into his tent, in the presence of MM. de Guise and the Constable, to hear from him whence he had his knowledge, and who had told him the attack was to be made; and said if he did not speak the truth he would have him hanged. Then he declared he lay down under the King's bed thinking to sleep, and so having heard the plan he revealed it to a captain who was a friend of his, to the end he might prepare himself with his soldiers to be the first at the attack. Then the King knew the truth, and told him he should never serve him again, and that he deserved to be hanged, and forbade him ever to come again to the Court.</p>

<p>The groom of the chamber went away with this to swallow, and slept that night with a surgeon-in-ordinary of the King, Master Louis of Saint Andre; and in the night he gave himself six stabs with a knife, and cut his throat Nor did the surgeon perceive it till the morning, when he found his bed all bloody, and the dead body by him. He marvelled at this sight on his awaking, and feared they would say he was the cause of the murder; but he was soon relieved, seeing the reason, which was despair at the loss of the good friendship of the King.</p>

<p>So Guyard was buried. And those of Danvilliers, when they saw the breach large enough for us to enter, and our soldiers ready to assault them, surrendered themselves to the mercy of the King. Their leaders were taken prisoners, and their Soldiers were sent away without arms.</p>

<p>The camp being dispersed, I returned to Paris with my gentleman whose leg I had cut off; I dressed him, and God healed him. I sent him to his house merry with a wooden leg; and he was content saying he had got off cheap, not to have been miserably burned to stop the blood, as you write in your book, won petit matetre,</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>Some time after. King Henry raised an army of thirty thousand men, to go and lay waste the country about Hesdin. The King of Navarre, who was then called M. de Vendosme, was chief of the army, and the King's Lieutenant. Being at St. Denis, in France, waiting while the companies passed by, he sent to Paris for me to speak with him. When I came he begged me (and his request was a command) to follow him on this journey; and I, wishing to make my excuses, saying my wife was sick in bed, he made answer there were physicians in Pairs to cure her, and he, too, had left his wife, who was of as good a house as mine, and he said he would use me well, and forthwith ordered I should be attached to his household. Seeing this great desire he had to take me with him, I dared not refuse him.</p>

<p>I went after him to Chateau le Comte, within three or four leagues of Hesdin. The Emperor's soldiers were in garrison there, with a number of peasants from the country road. M. de Vendosme called on them to surrender; they made answer that he should never take them, unless it were piecemeal; let him do his worst, and they would do their best to defend themselves. They trusted in their moats, which were full of water; but in two hours, with plenty of faggots and casks, we made a way for our infantry to pass over, when they had to advance to the assault; and the place was attacked with five cannons, and a breach was made large enough for our men to enter; where those within received the attack very valiantly, and killed and wounded a great number of our men with arquebuses, pikes, and stones. </p>

<p>In the end, when they saw themselves overpowered, they set fire to their powder and ammunition, whereby many of our men were burned, and some of their own. And they were almost all put to the sword; but some of our soldiers had taken twenty or thirty, hoping to have ransom for them: and so soon as this was known, orders were given to proclaim by trumpet through the camp, that all soldiers who had Spaniards for prisoners must kill them, on pain of being themselves hanged and strangled: which was done in cold blood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All the climaxes produced mountainous islands or highlands that shed vast amounts of debris westward to form clastic wedges or delta complexes on the continental margin. (Rodgers, 1983, p. 229)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thence we went and burned several villages; and the barns were all full of grain, to my very great regret. We came as far as Tournahan, where there was a large tower, whither the enemy withdrew, but we found the place empty: our men sacked it, and blew up the tower with a mine of gunpowder, which turned it upside down. After that, the camp was dispersed, and I returned to Paris. And the day after Chateau le Comte was taken, M. de Vendosme sent a gentleman under orders to the King, to report to him all that had happened, and among other things he told the King I had done very good work dressing the wounded, and had showed him eighteen bullets that I had taken out of their bodies, and there were many more that I had not been able to find or take out; and he spoke more good of me than there was by half. </p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Then the King said he would take me into his service, and commanded M. de Goguier, his first physician, to write me down in the King's service as one of his surgeons-in-ordinary, and I was to meet him at Rheims within ten or twelve days: which I did. And the King did me the honour to command me to live near him, and he would be a good friend to me. Then I thanked him most humbly for the honour he was pleased to do me, in appointing me to serve him.</p>]]></description><link>http://www.andersschmidt.com/2014/07/28/the-scientific-journal/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">cf18db59-eee4-4da5-a26a-8e44602194e0</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anders Schmidt Hansen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2014 17:33:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[My top 4 Adobe Project Parfait features you might love too]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>What's up evil, creative masterminds of the digital design and development arena? What have you been crafting today? Much? Nothing? In any case, if you have 180 seconds to waste anyway, I just wanted to share a little list of features that I've come to like about Adobe's "comp-to-code" web application called "Project Parfait".</p>

<p>Yep, pop in that PSD and get some nifty information needed for turning that static file into something magic. Pretty simple, but it's nice to see some software that seamlessly accepts a PSD without being a pain in the ass. So without any further ado, here's the top 4 features I like about Project Parfait:</p>

<h2 id="1typographicoverviews">1. Typographic Overviews</h2>

<p>That's right, after uploading the PSD, you can click on text anywhere in the document and see its font family (if on TypeKit), weights and what sizes are being used where. A very nice feature in itself, but what I didn't expect is the ability to switch between different font units. I usually develop in <code>rem</code>, so being able to switch to that unit is really handy (for me, at least).</p>

<h2 id="2elementdistancecalculations">2. Element Distance Calculations</h2>

<p>Project Parfait supports clicking and then shift-clicking on two elements which will give you the x and y distance (in pixels only, it seems) between the two. I've received several PSDs from a graphic designer and sometimes ended up pixel pushing things until it looked right visually, only to eventually jump into the PSD and manually using the ruler tool to calculate the distance. No need for that anymore!</p>

<h2 id="3colorpaletteextraction">3. Color Palette Extraction (!)</h2>

<p>It might seem like a banality, but if I had a dollar for every time I had to either a.) extract a color palette manually because no one supplied me with any web-friendly values or b.) email clients or associated designers for those values I'd finally be able to get that ruby-covered gold scepter I've always wanted... Project Parfait allows you to quickly extract those values and have them ready-at-hand. I like that.</p>

<h2 id="4csscodepreview">4. CSS Code Preview</h2>

<p>This is a no-brainer, but incredibly helpful; click on an element and you will get a (well-)generated CSS code for that element in a previewer window. I know it's simple, but ignoring the width and height code, it makes it very easy to just click, copy and paste into your stylesheet. My only concern is how this fits a workflow involving pre-processors such as Sass or Less. It could be interesting to see if Project Parfait could understand a specific naming convention of a PSDs folder structure that would then translate into neatly organized components... or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Aight, everything must come to an end, <a href='https://projectparfait.adobe.com/' >Project Parfait</a> has more features to offer, and you should give it a little checkout when you get the time. I'll definitely try giving it a spin into my workflow.</p>

<p>Keep awesome!</p>]]></description><link>http://www.andersschmidt.com/2014/07/24/my-top-4-adobe-project-parfait-features-you-might-love-too/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">069fda93-7ba0-48ee-a565-cfcaf057b418</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anders Schmidt Hansen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2014 09:04:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Convert and create Polymer elements online with Polymeister]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick shoot-out to <a href='http://polymeister.somee.com/' >Polymeister</a>, an online tool that allows you to generate Polymer elements (nested ones even!) easily.

<p>It's no surprise that I have an odd tendency to find myself stumbling along the bleeding edges of web technologies, trying out almost a little too much. "You collect technologies like others collect Pokémon cards!" is something I hear often (ahem <a href='https://twitter.com/chorDK' >Lasse</a>!) </p>

<p>I can't help it though, I love learning new things. And my newest addition to my "deck of techs" is <a href='http://polymer-project.org/' >Polymer</a> - a solution that enables the use of custom web components or "elements" within web projects. After my initial run-ins I don't doubt that web components (not necessarily Polymer per se) will bring on a tectonic shift in the landscape of the web in the coming years, and isn't it awesome that you can already play with it today? I knew you'd think so too!</p>

<h3 id="but">But...</h3>

<p>Creating Polymer elements is quite straightforward out-of-the-box, but it does take the usual "create folder,  install bower and npm, create the typical hello-world element, refresh browser, check, refresh browser, check et cetera"-process to really get started. </p>

<p>In short: It's okay when still playing in the sandbox, but I want a sexier way of going from idea to crafting an element to releasing it.</p>

<h3 id="introducingabathur">Introducing "Abathur"</h3>

<p>Yes, it's a Starcraft reference, and yes it's totally the right name for something that literally spins Polymer elements like it was the easiest thing in the world. By allowing you to use <a href='http://www.andersschmidt.com/slim-lang.com' >Slim</a>, <a href='http://sass-lang.com/' >Sass</a> and <a href='http://coffeescript.org/' >CoffeeScript</a> to craft the element and then automatically get it compiled into .html, .min.css and .min.js via <a href='http://gulpjs.com/' >Gulp</a> is awesome<sup>10th</sup>. But let's take it to the <sup>11th</sup> and throw in live browser reloading and synchronization between multiple browsers and devices with <a href='http://www.andersschmidt.com/www.browsersync.io' >BrowserSync</a>. Boom!</p>

<p>Abathur is still in <strong>experimental alpha</strong>, but you can definitely use it to spin som elements already. You'll find Abathur <a href='https://github.com/AndersSchmidtHansen/Abathur' >here</a>, ready to download. If you want a small introduction, you can see me stumble like a goose in this video:</p>

Blogging has come a very long way technologically, and if you're still wondering how much you need to pay or what host to choose, there's now yet another new and interesting approach; Ghost!</p>

<p>You can learn more about the Ghost blogging platform <a href='https://ghost.org/about/' >here</a>, but in this article I'll cover how to get a Ghost blog up and running at the cost of absolutely nothing. Zero, null, nuffin' (if that's even a word).</p>

<p>All you need is a <a href='https://github.com/join' >GitHub Account</a>, a cup of coffee and a little patience.</p>

<h2 id="steponeprepareagithubrepository">Step one, prepare a GitHub repository</h2>

<p>After creating your GitHub account, follow GitHub's own guide on <a href='https://pages.github.com/' >how to prepare GitHub Pages for your repository</a>.</p>

<p>You should then end up with a repository with an URL of something like:</p>

<pre><code>GitHubUsername.github.io
</code></pre>

<p>Also, if you want to use a custom domain (highly recommended!), be sure to add a CNAME file (in uppercase!) to your repository. You can do this by going to your repository and click on the + symbol next to your repository's name (in blue). Just name the file CNAME and input the domain you own here.</p>

<p><strong>Notice:</strong> I had to write <code>www.andersschmidt.com</code> even though some guides tell you can write the root version AKA the-one-without-the-www. After that I just forwarded <code>andersschmidt.com</code> to the www-version.</p>

<h3 id="settingupthedns">Setting up the DNS</h3>

<p>With the CNAME file in place, go to your DNS or the company that hosts your domain name and add a CNAME value where the <code>host</code> is <code>www</code> and the <code>destination</code> is <code>GitHubUsername.github.io</code>. I set my TTL to 10 minutes, but you can keep it at 1 hour if you want.</p>

<h2 id="steptwoinstallghost">Step two, install Ghost</h2>

<p>Go <a href='http://docs.ghost.org/installation/' >here</a> for downloads specific to  your operating system (I use Linux / ElementaryOS), download Ghost and follow the installation instructions.</p>

<p>I have my <code>Blog</code> folder inside Dropbox for extra backup, but your mileage may vary. After installing Ghost and confirming that it does actually run, it's time to bring it to GitHub via a sweet  piece of code named Buster.</p>

<h2 id="stepthreeinstallbuster">Step three, install Buster</h2>

<p><a href='https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster' >Buster</a> takes your Ghost blog and turns it into a static site in a format that GitHub likes, meaning that it is possible to bring your blog to the repository you made earlier. Neat huh? And since the repository is free, so is your blog!</p>

<p>To install Buster, you first need <a href='https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html' >Pip</a> and how easy it is to install depends on your operating system (on Linux it's easy). After installing Pip you can then run the following in your terminal or console:</p>

<pre><code>pip install buster
</code></pre>

<p>Remember to have <code>wget</code> installed beforehand, since it's required if you want to use Buster. Most Linux versions have wget by default, but if you're on a Mac, you can run:</p>

<pre><code>brew install wget
</code></pre>

<p>After Buster is installed, navigate to your Ghost blog's folder and run <code>buster setup</code> to prepare things. You will have to input the URL to your GitHub repository you made earlier for this to work.</p>

<p>Hereon it's pretty straightforward. After starting up Ghost via <code>npm start</code>, go to <a href='http://127.0.0.1:2368/ghost/' >http://127.0.0.1:2368/ghost/</a> and begin writing what you want, preview it locally and when you're ready to push it online, do the following:</p>

<pre><code>buster generate --domain=http://127.0.0.1:2368 &amp;&amp; buster deploy
</code></pre>

<p>You will be prompted to input your GitHub credentials and if things are correct Buster will push the static site version of your blog to your GitHub repository and prezto, your blog is now live! For free. Isn't that nifty?</p>

<h2 id="optionalstepfasterdeployment">Optional step: faster deployment</h2>

<p>If you're on a NIX-based system like Linux or Mac OS, it is possible to make it less annoying to generate and deploy your Ghost site. I personally think it's tedious to copy and paste the above command every time, so I made a small BASH script you can add to your <code>.bashrc</code> file to speed things up a little:</p>

<pre><code>openGhost(){
  cd ~/Your/Blog/Folder/;
  npm start;
}
alias ghost=openGhost;
alias ghostup="sudo buster generate --domain=http://127.0.0.1:2368 &amp;&amp; sudo buster deploy";
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ghost</code> command will, if you've correctly changed the <code>Your/Blog/Folder</code> to match the folder your Ghost blog lives in, neatly start up Ghost from wherever you are in your system and the <code>ghostup</code> command will simply run the previous command you had to copy and paste.</p>

<p>It's not much, but if you write a lot it's a neat timesaver.</p>

<p>In closing, enjoy blogging with Ghost for free and help spread the love!</p>]]></description><link>http://www.andersschmidt.com/2014/07/12/fast-free-blogging-with-ghost-and-github/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5400bd89-9168-45a7-a579-1edb11844f82</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Anders Schmidt Hansen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2014 17:46:24 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
